#### Mark McCurdy  
I'm a prior long time UNIX administrator in DFIR. I'm sharing many of my enumerated findings here.  Output here is the absorbed and restructured data from various sources to make sense through all the noise in the way I operate.  Besides techniques and procedures, my toolset list focuses on the broad spectrum of tools to perform forensics on Windows and Linux systems.  
  
It'll mature over time. This is not a dead drop site.
