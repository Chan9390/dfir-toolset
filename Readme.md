#### Mark McCurdy  
I'm a long time UNIX administrator with a flair for organization and documentation. With my newfound shift into DFIR, 
I've started this github repo.  Output here is the absorbed and restructured data from various sources to make sense through all the noise.
I'm focusing on the broad spectrum of tools to perform forensics on Windows and Linux systems with the ephasis being tools running on Linux.
Red team tools are minimally listed here.
