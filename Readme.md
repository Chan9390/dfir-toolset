#### Mark McCurdy  
I'm a prior long time UNIX administrator with my newfound shift into DFIR, I'm cataloging my findings for DFIR to share.  Output here is the absorbed and restructured data from various sources to make sense through all the noise.  I'm focusing on the broad spectrum of tools to perform forensics on Windows and Linux systems with the emphasis being tools running on Linux.  
  
Red team tools are minimally listed here.
