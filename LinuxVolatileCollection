VOLATILE DATA COLLECTION STEPS  
• System date and time
• On the compromised machine, run a trusted command shell from a toolkit with statically compiled binaries (e.g., on older nonproprietary versions of the Helix CD, or other distributions).  
• Run script to start a log of your keystrokes.  
• Document the date and time of the computer and compare it with a reliable time source.  
• Acquire contents of physical memory.  
• Gather hostname, IP address, and operating system details.  
• Gather system status and environment details.  
• Identify users logged onto the system.  
• Inspect network connections and open ports and associated activity.  
• Examine running processes, tree format, and pmap or lsof  
• Correlate open ports to associated processes and programs.  
• Determine what files and sockets are being accessed.  
• Examine loaded modules and drivers.  
• Examine connected host names.  
• Examine command-line history.  
• Identify mounted shares.  
• Check for unauthorized accounts, groups, shares, and other system resources and configurations.  
• Determine scheduled tasks.  
• Collect clipboard contents.  
• Determine audit policy configuration.  
• Terminate script to finish logging of your keystrokes by typing exit.  
• File listing of each partition during the live response using The SleuthKit (e.g., /media/cdrom/Linux-IR/fls /dev/hda1 –lr -m /
• /proc/kcore for an ELF formatted memory for use with gdb  
• printenv
• /proc/verions for compiler version
• sa command if auditd is running
linux-explorer.sh
