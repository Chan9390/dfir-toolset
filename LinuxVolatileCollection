VOLATILE DATA COLLECTION STEPS  
• On the compromised machine, run a trusted command shell from a toolkit with statically compiled binaries (e.g., on older nonproprietary versions of the Helix CD, or other distributions).  
• Run script to start a log of your keystrokes.  
• Document the date and time of the computer and compare it with a reliable time source.  
• Acquire contents of physical memory.  
• Gather hostname, IP address, and operating system details.  
• Gather system status and environment details.  
• Identify users logged onto the system.  
• Inspect network connections and open ports and associated activity.  
• Examine running processes.  
• Correlate open ports to associated processes and programs.  
• Determine what files and sockets are being accessed.  
• Examine loaded modules and drivers.  
• Examine connected host names.  
• Examine command-line history.  
• Identify mounted shares.  
• Check for unauthorized accounts, groups, shares, and other system resources and configurations.  
• Determine scheduled tasks.  
• Collect clipboard contents.  
• Determine audit policy configuration.  
• Terminate script to finish logging of your keystrokes by typing exit.
