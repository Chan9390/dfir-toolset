Security Onion Breakdown
-ELSA receives or queries local syslog data and stores into mysql.  Any regex against it is searched with sphinxsearch.
-OSSEC looks at the local OS and writes to a local file. A tcl daemon then writes it to the squil database.
-Snort looks at the network and writes to a unified2 file. There's a rule-=update command to update emerging threats rules.
-netsniff is running also writing to a dailylogs directory that I can't tell how this pcap generator fits into it all.
-barnyard2 is used to scrape the raw snort logs and write to squil's database.
-Bro queries squil from a tcl daemon and writes to its own bro logs. bro entries are within within sguil
   Bro will decode several protocols, find protocol anomalies (bad checksums), capture X.509 certs, and plugin capable.. 
   Bro has an intel framework to detect and alert on IP, domains, MD5s, others
-squil holds the harvested packets
-squert is a frontend to squil data.
